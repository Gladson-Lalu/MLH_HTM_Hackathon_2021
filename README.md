# MLH_HTM_Hackathon_2021
## Problem Statement:

Books are the main pillar of education.
We need books when we want to learn something new, when we get promoted to a new class then we need books for that new class and there are many more such situations.
For this, we either prefer new books or many times we prefer books from our seniors or some old books from book store at very low cost.
So the idea is to basically make a platform where we will be able to get Books for books.
Suppose someone is in class 9th and he is going in class 10th then he will go to our platform and will search for class 10th books....for each book he will take of class 10th he has to give one book which will be of class 9th..so he will order class 10th books and will pay online which will store on our platform only... during delivery he will receive class 10th books which he ordered similarly he will give his class 9th books..after confirmation of books he provided he will get his money back..so he got books for books.
The process will create a chain among all standards..

so he will pay for books and that money will store on our platform and during delivery, he will also give us book which he said to provide earlier during booking...and when we will confirm that we also received books from him, we will return his money back...so he will get books for books.
Suppose he is in 9th standard then he will give his books which someone who is in 8th will get and will give his 8th standard... it's not limited to only school level but also if someone bought a novel and he read it then he will give it to us and take another novel from our platform, after reading it he will give it and take another...so even if he bought a novel only one time he is able to read many novels because our platform linked all such guys and created a chain
