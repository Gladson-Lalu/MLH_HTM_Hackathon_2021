# MLH_HTM_Hackathon_2021
## Problem Statement:

Books are the main pillar of education.
We need books when we want to learn something new, when we get promoted to new class then we need books of that new class and there are many more such situations.
For this we either prefer new books or many times we prefer books from our seniors or some old books from book store at very low cost.
So idea is to basically make a platform where we will be able to get Books for books.

Suppose someone is in class 9th and he is going in class 10th then he will go to our platform and will search for class 10th books....for each book he will take of class 10th he has to give one book which will be of class 9th..so he will order class 10th books and will pay online which will store on our platform only... during delivery he will receive class 10th books which he ordered similarly he will give his class 9th books..after confirmation of books he provided he will get his money back..so he got books for books..
